# Playing Card Recognition
A simple console application that segments cards from an image and calculates their value. 

## Introduction
The aim of the project is to sort the cards in the picture by their value (from
the smallest to the largest). The cards were randomly scattered on a black background. The algorithm does not use a priori knowledge (for example, knowledge of the number of cards in the picture or cards size). 

## Features 
The algorithm was tested for the original photo and three modified ones. 

### Input
Picture of the cards (in this case it's the modified one with salt and pepper noise.

### Output 
Segmented cards after the perspective transformation saved in separate files.

And the result printed in the console.

Sorted cards values:
